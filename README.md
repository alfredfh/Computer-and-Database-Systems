# Computer Systems

## Objective

Learn fundamental concepts such as computer architecture, operating systems, and networking. Gaining an understanding of how computer architecture defines the structure and functionality of computers, including the role of CPUs, memory, and input/output devices. I also explored operating systems, focusing on their ability to manage hardware resources, process scheduling, and file systems, which ensure smooth operation of computer systems. Additionally, I learned about networking, including the principles of communication protocols, data transmission, and how networks like the internet function. This knowledge provided a foundation for understanding how different system components interact to support computing tasks.

# Database Systems

## Objective

The objective of the assignment is to develop a simplified version of the classic Battleships game. In this game, the computer randomly places five ships of different sizes and point values on a 10x10 grid. The player selects grid squares to fire at, trying to hit and sink the ships. Points are awarded for hitting ships, and the game ends either after 10 shots or when all ships are sunk. The player is notified of hits and misses, and their score is displayed at the end. Additionally, a debug mode allows the player to see the ship locations during gameplay.

### Skills Learned

-  Developed Battleships game in Java, focusing on OOP principles.
-  Creating simple graphical dialog and menu to develop the interface and basic event handling.
-  Utilising variables, constructors and getter/setter to manage the ships and users demonstrating principle of encapsulation.
-  Use of loops, arrays, collections, and associations to implement the game logic as defined above.

### Tools Used

- The use of Eclipse IDE for JAVA developers
