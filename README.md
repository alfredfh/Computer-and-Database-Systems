# Computer-and-Database-Systems

# Computer Systems

## Objective

Learn fundamental concepts such as computer architecture, operating systems, and networking. Gaining an understanding of how computer architecture defines the structure and functionality of computers, including the role of CPUs, memory, and input/output devices. I also explored operating systems, focusing on their ability to manage hardware resources, process scheduling, and file systems, which ensure smooth operation of computer systems. Additionally, I learned about networking, including the principles of communication protocols, data transmission, and how networks like the internet function. This knowledge provided a foundation for understanding how different system components interact to support computing tasks.

# Database Systems

## Objective

This course gave a foundational understanding of databases and allowed the development of practical skills needed to design and implement a relational database for a given scenario. The coursework required creating an entity-relationship diagram, normalising the database structure and implementing it using MariaDB. Furthermore, we were challenged to create SQL statements to address given queries.

### Skills Learned

-  SQL querys
-  Relational Databases
-  Creating tables and defining the primary and foreign keys, and assigning datatypes to the attributes.

### Tools Used
  -  SQL statements
  -  MariaDB

### Entity-relationship Diagram
